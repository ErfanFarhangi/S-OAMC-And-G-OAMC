# S-OAMC-And-G-OAMC
Mobility-aware computation offloading in edge-computing using machine learning



The source codes for six methods, including S-OAMC, OAMC, S-OAMC-WP, G-OAMC, BFD, and IP are provided in the file "Codes.cpp". The codes are all implemented in c++. 

We provided 5 different size datasets composed of cloudlets, applications and their predicted specification by the matrix completion method in Data folder. These datasets must be in the same path of the code when you want to run the code. 


How to run the code?


We used visual studio environment to develop the code. You can downlaod visual stuio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. To run the code using visual studio, you need to first configure visual studio to use IBM CPLEX Concert. Instructions for configuration are availble at https://www.leandro-coelho.com/how-to-configure-ms-visual-studio-to-use-ibm-cplex-concert/
